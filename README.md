# [WIP] node-codesandbox

## Isn't this the same as the CodeSandbox CLI?

I created this to create a more flexible way of uploading code to CodeSandbox. This Node package lets you specify what files to include, exclude and add to the upload which allows for very precise and/or custom uploads.

## Shouldn't this be part of the `codesandbox-importers` monorepo?

I might look into that once this gets to a more final state, its currently still WIP.
